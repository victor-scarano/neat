# Neat

An implementation of the NEAT algorithm (Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) in Rust.

This implementation is based off Kenith Stanley's [paper](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).

## Features

- [ ] Feed forward neural network implementation
- [ ] Recurrent neural network implementation
- [ ] Serde support for individual genomes
- [ ] Serde support for full populations
- [ ] Evolution of multiple populations concurrently
- [ ] Concurrent evolution of a single population
